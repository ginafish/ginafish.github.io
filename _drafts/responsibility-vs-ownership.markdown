Resist the urge to assign blame. It keeps you from hearing what will actually keep the problem from happening again. Blame isn't binary - what signals did you ignore? Focus on what you can learn from it.

Ownership != Responsibility != Blame
Ownership doesn't == follow up
Responsibility doesn't == ownership, it means follow up and ideally is shared
Blame happens when you have one but not the other
Once you have a "culprit" assigned, your mind will jump through whatever hoops necessary to make thay reality
Leadership means taking responsibility - not ownership - over systemic issues. Responsible for finding solutions, and enabling others to own the work to fix it. Also responsibility for outcomes means overseeing the work and reassessing if the outcomes are achievable
Own work, not outcomes. Responsibility => ownership of outcomes
Be willing to reassess your initial assumptions throughout implementation
Sunk cost fallacy
Responsibility is meaningless when assigned

Retroactive discussions about ownership end with ownership being a shut down to the conversation ("I/you own this. Figure it out.") or only useful for assigning blame.
Did the "owner" have necessary resources or context to achieve the desired outcome?

We invest a lot of resources into validating hunches, without doing due diligence to figure out the minimum amount of resources it makes sense to invest, or assessing prior to completion
Hard handoffs are way less efficient - by pretending that we're not a team, but a set of individuals, we're ignoring that we're greater than the sum of our parts

A blame free retro == we agree that it is natural and normal to feel responsibility and emotions about something, and we want to focus on OUTCOMES and fix problems, not people
Success for an organization means being responsible for things you don't own
It is normal and natural to only look for things that solidify your beliefs. Build processes to help you question your beliefs, and avoid sunk cost fallacy
