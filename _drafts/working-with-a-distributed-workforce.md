# Speak in public

If something is worth asking, ask it in a public channel.

* Gives visibility to your teammates, who may be wondering the same thing
* Helps give stakeholders who aren't directly involved in the project more visibility - both in the progress of the project and 
* Avoids the problem of decisions being made in secret and not communicated to all interested parties
  * Ever worked on something, only to find out that your lead decided it wasn't necessary while you were working on it?
