## Acknowledge the complexity

Give your complexity estimate separate from your time estimate.

If you want to help build an understanding of how high complexity objects can spiral deadlines, use the complexity as a modifier for your time estimate.

Ex: I have this feature I think I can do in 14 days

Low complexity: 1.2x
Medium complexity: 1.8x
High complexity: 2.2x

applied to the gut estimate...

Low complexity: ~17 days
Medium complexity: ~25 days
High complexity: ~31 days

Because you communicate those estimates separately, you can have a more honest conversation about whether a project is on track or not.
