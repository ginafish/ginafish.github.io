### How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age

by Dale Carnegie

Picked up the "Digital Age" version because that was what was available at my local library.

I want to go back and read the non-updated version!

Pros:

* Honestly timeless advice for building relationships and making people feel valued
* Some great examples of how you can apply the advice socially and in the workplace
* Has been living rent-free in my brain since I've read it

Cons:

* The updated examples, such as the example of how Microsoft responded to user feedback, felt like a bit of a stretch
* Lots of veneration for historical figures, and very idealized stories glorifying public figures, that were hard to relate to

Absolutely something to read if you want to be a better human. The advice truly stands up to the test of time - people want to feel valued and appreciated regardless of how much technology advances, go figure.
